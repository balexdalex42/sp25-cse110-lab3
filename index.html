                <h2>This Week's Agenda</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, we have a lot going on the mind today with a <b>LOT</b> of projects at hand. We will try to 
                    throw out ideas on how to best approach these things in a time-efficient and just mentally less-intensive way. Another 
                    thing to consider is just the pure amount of other extracurricular stuff going on this week as well.
                </p>
                <h3>Projects This Week</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a couple important projects I need to warn you guys about. Just so we can make ourselves aware and understand 
                    the amount of time commitment we need to make to academics this week or two.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>CSE 120 Project on Threads</strong><br>
                            I think this will be a pretty intensive project, need to definitely start looking at the specifications, 
                            read the textbook, and also I need to talk to teammates to understand how we are going to go about splitting the 
                            work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em><strong>Anniversary Game</strong><br></em>
                            Please for the sake of God, we need to absolutely finish this. I already feel the work piling up and I think this 
                            is the last chance to truly make a sprint to the finish line. Remember though, we cannot compromise the quality 
                            of this project in order to get it out faster. If it must take another week, it will take an extra week!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Homework</h3>
                <p>
                    There are also several homeworks due in these coming days (some with higher priority over others) for all my classes. I am 
                    just telling everyone so they can be aware and so that they can prep for a <em>long</em> winter.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>CSE 110 Sprints and Labs</b><br>
                            Almost done with this lab but still have a few more things to do. I also need to make sure to finish the sprint 
                            for our team because it was just introduced last night.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><i>CSE 190 HW2</i></strong><br>
                            Need to make sure to start that tonight. It will probably be a heavier homework and I cannot wait until the last 
                            minute since it seems pretty math heavy. I also need to review some of the lecture notes to catch up Thursday's 
                            lecture that I missed out on. I will probably not do the homework this week in LaTeX.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>CSE 120 HW1</em></strong><br>
                            Need to read a little bit in the textbook and review slides to finish the homework. Doesn't look too bad and 
                            the homework is also pretty much graded on completion so it should not be that much of a priority, though it is due 
                            tonight at 11:59 PM.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ECE 35</strong><br>
                            I need to finish the next two homeworks that will be due tomorrow and a couple days after that. I should also find time 
                            to do the practice problems to help prepare me for the quiz that will be coming up very soon!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>CSE 105 HW3</strong><br>
                            I need to make sure to start this as soon as I am done with everything. I already took a drop grade with the last 
                            because I started too late and cannot afford to miss another homework...
                        </li>

                    <h2>Unfinished Business</h2>
                    <p>
                        Honestly, there is not a lot of unfinished business from last week. We definitely underestimated the scope and sheer 
                        time it would take to complete the <em>Anniversary Game</em>, but we already talked about that. Some other unfinished 
                        business is the lab work we have to do, which for this week was just reading the research papers and learning some 
                        basic numpy and pytorch.

                    <h2>Something Just Came to Our Attention</h2>
                    <p>
                        There have been some questions and concerns before this meeting we would like everyone to know about. I will try 
                        to go over and answer them to the best of my abilities.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Questions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Will the concert still be happening?</h4>
                                Yes it still will be happening and we need to figure out how to manage our time Wednesday so that 
                                we can have a maximal enjoying experience at the concert. Also we need to do research and prep for 
                                the drive beforehand.

                                <h4>What is the game plan for the game?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I think the basic game plan will be based off of a few deliverables (based on priority):
                                    </p>
                                    <ol type="a">

                                            Designing the Interactable Objects and Interaction Detection
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Designing Pop-Ups with Text (possibly dialog boxes as well). For example, there should be 
                                            the button that opens up the collection of fragments, each fragment with their own 
                                            respective description. Another thing to think about would be the fact that the text kind 
                                            of <em>writes</em> as it opens. Not sure if I want the interactables to be used in the
                                            ~game whenever (sort of like having an inventory).

                                                    object should contain name, source image, coordinates, collision box, visibility, 
                                                    and potentially other metadata (transparent bottom, solid top).

                                <strong>ANSWER</strong>: One step at a time. We need to prioritize school work obviously, but a 
                                major thing to consider is the sheer amount of wasted time caused by <b><i>doom-scrolling</i></b>. 
                                If we can somehow mitigate that time-wasting and also try to maximize how we study/finish our work, 
                                everything could definitely be possible. Please just do not give up before anything has started and 
                                try to things step by step!

                                <h4>Sleep Schedule</h4>
                                Understandably, the sleep schedule has not been so great, but we need to try to grind a little bit more 
                                this week and can hopefully chill out. The thing is that a lot of assignments are very high priority and 
                                we have no idea on how time-consuming those things will be until we try. The biggest thing is that we 
                                have been actually getting decent sleep, though sleeping late. I would rather us get a little less sleep, wake 
                                up earlier, so we can sleep earlier.

                                <h4>Implausibility for Depth in Courses This Quarter</h4>
                                This is also an understandable concern. How are we going to manage all these 20 units, doing the homeworks, 
                                projects, and meeting the strict deadlines while also trying to go deep into each of the subjects. The fact 
                                is that we are going to have to focus a bit harder (less Instagram, Youtube, and Clash Royale) and spend some 
                                free time reading extra and what not. If we are really so interested in going ahead and learning more like 
                                we say we are, extra readings should honestly be fun and not feel like a chore! Hopefully, we can figure out 
                                our schedule and time requirements for each of the classes so that we can fully gauge how we can be a better 
                                student and gain the most knowledge and skills we can without getting burnt out. 
                                <b>NOTE: THIS MEAN WE NEED TO ALSO STILL ENJOY THE PROCESS (WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING IT FOR)!!!</b>
